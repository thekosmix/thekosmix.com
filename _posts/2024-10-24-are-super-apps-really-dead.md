How was your The Great Indian Festival sale shopping experience at [Amazon](https://amazon.in/)? Mine was amazing, as always. But what else do you use the Amazon app for? 

I know that Amazon may not have the best UI but it has the best UX. They have integrated plethora of services in it seamlessly and it feels very obvious to me. For me, it has become the go-to app for all my needs.

## Shopping
### Categories
From ordering medicines, groceries to a plethora of categories of shopping, Amazon has answers to everyday needs. They truly mean when they say "A to Z" [Letter a and z are connected with a smile in their logo] And they have a huge huge range of products in every category, be it fashion or electronics or books. And the rates are comparable to almost all e-commerce out there.

### Delivery and Return
When it comes to relying on getting what you have ordered and in the condition you expect it to be, I can only trust Amazon. Flipkart had to implement Open-Box delivery and other ecom also has some kind of OTP or other verification in place, but Amazon has been absolutely amazing when it comes to hassle free reliable delivery. Even their return is super-easy and trustworthy.

## Amazon Pay
### Services
Same as multiple other apps, you would be able to book gas cylinder, book flight tickets or make you credit card payments. You also get reminders about your recharge and bills which is an added bonus. 

### Payments
From UPI to credit card to phone and electricity bills, you will be able to make all sorts of payments with it, there's no need to have another app and the response time is also amazing.

## Devices
### Alexa
Once I booked my gas cylinder with Alexa (for a discount), but now it's so easy with it. I'm just sitting and watching a movie and then someone reminds me of it, I just have to tell Alexa to book it and it gets delivered in the next few days. No context switching, no app launch, it's just that simple. In fact, all my smart home appliances like air purifiers, ACs, bulbs, TVs and many more are connected with it and to control them, I just have to talk with it. 

And there's more to it, daily reminders, listening to the music which randomly came to my mind, navigating through Fire TV stick (Yes, it does that!!).

### Fire TV stick
These devices has more power than the costlier smart TVs out there. I have a 4K LG smart TV, but I still prefer to use a fire TV stick, because of the smoother experience. The seamless connection with Alexa let me control it through voice command without even knowing where the TV/stick remotes are. And moreover, it has display mirroring which enables me to use my Ubuntu Touch device as a desktop computer.

### The money maker - Prime
Amazon makes a lot of money with Prime subscription and buy in customer's brand loyalty and once you have purchased it and utilized it, there's no going back. Prime is not just a subscription for blazing fast delivery, but it's an ecosystem in itself. You have all the devices running with it, fire TV stick has Prime Video, Alexa, Music and much more.
