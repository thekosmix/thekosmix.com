Hampi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India, is a mesmerizing destination that transports you back in time.

Once the glorious capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, it's now a captivating collection of ruins, temples, and historical monuments scattered across a unique boulder-strewn landscape. Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, one of the largest and most powerful empires in South India during the 14th-16th centuries. During its peak, Hampi was a thriving city, renowned for its wealth, trade, and magnificent architecture.
