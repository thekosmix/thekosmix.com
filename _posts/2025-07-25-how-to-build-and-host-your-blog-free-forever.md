Blogging is a soothing way to share you experiences and opinions with the world. 

Many people want to do it with a lot of features like comments, chat, albums etc, but their cost can mount up for individual services. I'll share how I run multiple blogs that too for free with features. I only pay for domain names and nothing else.

## Get (Buy) a domain name
I use [GoDaddy](godaddy.com) to get the domains as their UX is simple comapred to others I've used in past. This is the only money you'll have to spend. Also, GoDaddy provides free website creator tool as well which you explore to create your own blog.

## Create a blog
While there are multiple online tools like wordpress 


1. Create static website using https://jekyllrb.com/ 
2. Use Disqus plugin to add comment functionality
3. Use Zendesk Sunshine Conversations (formerly Smooch) to integrate a chat and backend with slack.
4. Use Firebase hashtag#hosting to host these static pages: https://lnkd.in/dBqWD-2U 
5. Point firebase domain to your domain

I've created my hashtag#travelblog following above steps and it couldn't have been simpler: https://thekosmix.com/ 

It also boasts an album viewer, website search powered by lunr.js and much more!!
