        <p>I'm a guy from a small remote town of Uttar Pradesh, India. I've been to multiple Indian states & cities and maintain a <a href="https://www.wanderindia.blog/" target="_blank">travel blog</a> about them.</p> 
        <p>I have worked in startups and big organisations like Urban Company and Google in multiple cities. I once started my own venture as well: <a href="https://www.strollup.in/" target="_blank">StrollUp</a></p>
        <p>I have been very fortunate to have made friends along the way who have taught me different things and their values in life.</p>
        <p>This blog is a collection of my thoughts and experiences collected over time.<p>
